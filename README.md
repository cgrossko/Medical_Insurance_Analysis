**Overview**

This project involves the analysis of the insurance.csv dataset, which contains information about individuals' age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and medical charges. The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the factors that influence medical insurance charges and to explore any potential biases within the data.

**Dataset
**
The dataset insurance.csv contains the following columns:

age: Age of the individual
sex: Gender of the individual
bmi: Body Mass Index of the individual
children: Number of children/dependents covered by insurance
smoker: Smoking status of the individual (yes or no)
region: Region where the individual resides
charges: Medical insurance charges billed to the individual

**Objectives**

Visualize Average BMI by Region: Understand how BMI varies across different regions.

Create Pie Chart for Count of Smokers and Non-Smokers: Visualize the proportion of smokers and non-smokers in the dataset.

Convert String Columns for Analysis: Convert categorical columns such as sex, smoker, and region into numeric or dummy variables for analysis.

Predict Influential Features: Identify the most influential features for predicting medical insurance charges.

Explore Data Bias: Identify and discuss any potential biases in the data that could impact analysis.

Methodology

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Checked for null values in the dataset and handled any missing data.
Converted categorical columns to numeric values using encoding techniques.

**Data Visualization:**

Used seaborn and matplotlib libraries to create visualizations:

Average BMI by Region: A bar plot to show average BMI values across different regions.

Pie Chart for Smokers and Non-Smokers: A pie chart to visualize the proportion of smokers versus non-smokers.

**Feature Analysis:**

Used correlation analysis to identify relationships between features.

**Model Building:**

Implemented functions and classes to perform data analysis.
Used logistic regression to predict influential features for medical insurance charges.

**Bias Exploration:**

Analyzed potential biases in the dataset, such as overrepresentation of certain demographics.
Discussed the impact of these biases on the analysis and potential use cases.

**Results**

Visualization of Average BMI by Region: Highlighted regional differences in BMI, which could be indicative of lifestyle or environmental factors.

Proportion of Smokers and Non-Smokers: Provided insight into the prevalence of smoking within the dataset.

Influential Features for Insurance Charges: Identified key factors such as BMI, smoking status, and age as significant predictors of medical charges.

Potential Data Bias: Recognized the need for careful interpretation of results due to possible biases in the dataset.

**Conclusion**

This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors affecting medical insurance charges and highlights the importance of considering data biases in predictive modeling. The visualizations and models created in this project can serve as a foundation for further investigation and more refined analyses.
